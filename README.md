# THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL REPO, PLEASE THANK FreeApp2014 FOR THEIR WORK.
So far, the audio backend issues were killing me in the original repo. And "I've" implemented a really iffy way on fixing it.

# Malugri
Malugri is a modular app to play various formats of video game music. So far supported formats are the Nintendo audio formats (powered by [OpenRevolution library](https://github.com/ic-scm/OpenRevolution)). The MalugriPlayer core is made to be portable.

# Malugri Mobile
This is an implementation of Malugri for iOS devices, using [EZAudio](https://github.com/syedhali/EZAudio) library backend for audio playback, and AVFoundation for conversion features.

## Building
### NOTICE 
Please use homebrew ruby to install this as it caused me less issues on downgrading ruby dependencies.
### Dependencies
This project uses CocoaPods to ship dependencies. If you don't have it installed, you can visit https://cocoapods.org/#install for information on that. Then, in your project folder run
```
pod install
```
After the pods install, you should open the workspace (`.xcworkspace`) in Xcode (not `.xcodeproj`)
### OpenRevolution
In the source tree of this repository you can find the binary blob `openrevolution.a` which is compiled and tested to work with the current version. However if you like to build the library from source. To do that you should clone openrevolution repository, navigate to `src/lib` and put the [helping files](https://gist.github.com/FreeApp2014/132addc07f2148488127f32520a56f98). Running `a.sh` as a bash script will produce the `openrevolution.a` file you can use in the project. Issues related to using untested library versions are not reviewed. Issues related purely to the library should be reported to its issues tab.
