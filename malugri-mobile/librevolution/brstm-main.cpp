/*
DEBUGGING INSTRUCTIONS:

1. For every buffer (e.g., PCM_samples, PCM_buffer, ADPCM_buffer, etc.), ensure that you only call free/delete if and only if the pointer is non-null and was previously allocated by malloc/new. Never free memory you did not allocate.

2. If buffers are allocated conditionally, track their allocation status, or set pointers to nullptr after freeing them. This prevents double-free and use-after-free errors.

3. Double-freeing, or freeing a pointer not from malloc/new, will cause crashes like "pointer being freed was not allocated".

4. Enable Address Sanitizer in your project scheme for advanced runtime diagnostics. It can help catch heap and stack memory errors.
